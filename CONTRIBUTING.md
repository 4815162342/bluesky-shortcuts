# Contributing to bluesky-shortcuts

Thank you for your interest in contributing to bluesky-shortcuts! I'd be more than happy to receive pull requests, issues, feedback, or any other contributions.

## Submitting Changes

1. **Start with an Issue**: Whether you have a suggestion or want to contribute code, please start by creating an issue to discuss the change.

2. **Keep Changes Focused**: Since keyboard shortcuts are on Bluesky's official [roadmap](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/issues/640), I'd prefer small, focused patches that solve specific problems. I'd like this to be as useful as possible in the time it's around, and avoid spending a lot of time on "infrastructure" .

## Commit Messages

Clear commit messages help me understand changes. For small changes, one-line messages are fine. For larger changes, please use this format:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing, please open an issue and I'll be happy to help!
